# ANN-based-Motor-Temperature-Prediction

The heat loss and cooling modes of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) directly
affect the its temperature rise. The accurate evaluation and prediction of stator winding temperature
is of great significance to the safety and reliability of PMSMs. By the 

In order to study the influencing factors of stator winding temperature and prevent motor insulation ageing, insulation burning, permanent magnet demagnetization and other faults caused by high stator winding temperature, I am building a Artificial Neural Network Model proposed by Guo, Ding, et al.
